  "abstract": "Range restriction is a common problem in organizational research and is an important statistical artifact to correct for in meta-analysis. Historically, researchers have had to rely on range restriction corrections that only make use of range-restriction information for one variable, but it is not uncommon for researchers to have such information for both variables in a correlation (e.g., when studying the correlation between two predictor variables). Existing meta-analytic methods incorporating bivariate range-restriction corrections overlook their unique implications for estimating the sampling variance of corrected correlations and for accurately assigning weights to studies in individual-correction meta-analyses. We introduce new methods for computing individual-correction and artifact-distribution meta-analyses using the bivariate indirect range restriction (BVIRR; “Case V”) correction and describe improved methods for applying BVIRR corrections that substantially reduce bias in parameter estimation. We illustrate the effectiveness of these methods in a large-scale simulation and in meta-analyses of expatriate data. We provide R code to implement the methods described in this article; more comprehensive and robust functions for applying these methods are available in the psychmeta package for R.",

  "abstract": "Over the past four decades, psychometric meta-analysis (PMA) has emerged a key way that psychological disciplines build cumulative scientific knowledge. Despite the importance and popularity of PMA, software implementing the method has tended to be closed-source, inflexible, limited in terms of the psychometric corrections available, cumbersome to use for complex analyses, and/or costly. To overcome these limitations, we created the psychmeta R package: a free, open-source, comprehensive program for PMA.",

Inattention to effect size variability in meta-analyses may stem from a lack of guidelines for interpreting credibility intervals. In this commentary, we describe two methods for making practical interpretations and determining whether a particular SDρ represents a meaningful level of variability.",
